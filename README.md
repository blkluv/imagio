# `imagio` (WIP)

`imagio` is a web application that allows you to store and manage private images using [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/) and [Cloudflare Pages â†—](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) with the help of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework.

## Build

Please note that this project requires a paid plan of [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/).

To build and deploy imagio, follow the steps below:

1. Set up Cloudflare Pages with SvelteKit.
2. Set up environment variables (the `ACCOUNT_ID` and a read-write API token `CF_IMAGES_API_KEY`) in your Cloudflare dashboard.
3. Publish your pages.

## Endpoints

`imagio` provides the following endpoints:

- `/upload`: to upload images.
- `/images`: to list and modify uploaded images.
